## How to Use

Below are just some of the methods for installing ISSUE BLOG. Do not follow all of these instructions; just pick your favorite one.

### Simple Installation (without Fork)

```bash
.github
 |- workflow
    |- custom.js # site config
    |- cv.md # resume config
    |- main.yml # github actions config
```

1. Create the above files in your `github.io` repo, you can find the templates of these files at [`./template`](./template);
2. Edit `custom.js` and `cv.md` according to [Config Reference](#config-reference);
3. Edit `main.yml`, replace all `<your-github-name>` placeholder to your github account id.

### Common Installation (with Fork)

1. Fork this project, and rename it to `<your-github-name>.github.io`;
2. Edit `/config/custom.js` to config your site, follow [Config Reference](#config-reference).

### Custom Installation

If you don't want to override your existing github.io repo, you can push the code to the `source` branch of your repo.

```bash
# 1. clone this project
git clone https://github.com/Yidadaa/Issue-Blog-With-Github-Action.git

# 2. change the remote url
git remote set-url origin your-remote-github.io-repo.git

# 3. push code
git push origin -u source
```

Then go to `Settings -> Branches`, and change `Default branch` to `source` branch, we host the source code in `source` branch and deploy the static pages to `master` branch.

Finally, edit `/src/.vuepress/custom.js` to config your site, please follow [this section](#config-reference).

## FAQ

### 1. How to prevent others from publishing issues to the site?

You can set a white-list by setting `repoConfig.filterUsers` to `['Your Github ID', 'Another Friend's ID']`, default setting allows everyone to post a blog to your site.
